        <h3>Chef Banzai</h3>
        <p>Trained under Japanese sushi masters, since the age of 5 and for 72 years, Chef Banzai Sarumaku
          knows well how to fillet a fish by now. True to his family's Samurai heritage his filleting
          method is by sword, often accompanied by his notorious shreiking of samurai battle cries.
